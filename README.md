## üöÄ Getting Started

No complex setup is required to run this project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-kiosk.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd library-kiosk
    ```
3.  **Open the application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. For best results and to avoid potential CORS issues with local file access in the future, it's recommended to use a simple local server extension like [Live Server for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## üîß Customization & Configuration

This kiosk is designed to be easily adapted for other library systems.

### Adding/Editing Languages

1.  Open `index.js`.
2.  Locate the `translations` object.
3.  Add a new language object using its two-letter language code (e.g., `'fr'` for French).
4.  Copy the structure from the `'en'` object and translate all the string values.
5.  In `index.html`, add a new language button in the `language-buttons` div in the HTML body.

### Updating Prices

1.  **For Cost Calculation:** In the `calculateCost` function within `index.js`, update the values in the `rates` object.
2.  **For Display Modals:** In `index.html`, find the `price-modal` and `scan-price-modal` divs and update the price text displayed to the user.

### Changing Instructions

All final instruction text is located within the `translations` object in `index.js`. Find the relevant keys (e.g., `final_photocopying_ok`, `final_printing_pc`) and modify the HTML string to match your library's procedures.

### Theming & Styling

The visual theme can be easily changed by modifying the CSS variables at the top of the `index.css` file in the `:root` selector.

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #00A5A5;
    --background-color: #F9FAFB;
    --text-color: #007582;
    /* ... and more */
}
```
